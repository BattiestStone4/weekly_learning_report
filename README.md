# weekly_learning_report/学习周报

我的学习周报，受[这个项目](https://github.com/Kiprey/Skr_Learning)启发，对我的学习日报进行升级后再更新。

weekly reports for my study. Inspired by Kiprey/Skr_Learning &amp;&amp; continuing my report.

> 从2022年五月份开始，我就做过一次学习日报，那个时候还是发在交流群里大家监督。中间断过几次，但是基本保持了日更。但是我觉得这样的效果不好，因为我总是在报告里寄托了我的每日学习目标，然而我发现根本完不成。所以说，尽管做过一次改进，但是我最终还是选择了学习周报，附上每周学习笔记这样的形式。希望这一次能够坚持的久一点吧。

> I was keeping writing daily reports since May, 2022. During that time, I finished reports and send them to online group in order to let others urge me not to give up. Though I interrupted my reports several times for some reasons, I still keep them updated every day. However, I start to think that this is not the right way, since I always give a strong wish to set daily targets in my reports, I can't finish them at all. Finally I choose to write weekly reports with study notes in it. I hope this time I can keep on writing them for a longer time.
